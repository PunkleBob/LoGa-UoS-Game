LUTE
======
LUTE is a free, open source tool for crafting engaging location-based narrative games within Unity that utilises other plugins for XR support. LUTE is designed to be easily mastered by those who are already somewhat familiar to Unity, particularly for folks with no coding background. More experienced game developers can take the system further by tweaking the engine under the hood as there is no aspect of this tool that is closed.

LUTE empowers you to create story-driven, location-based XR games focused on cultural heritage.

Authors
======
LUTE originated from research within the LogaCulture project. It draws inspiration from notable tools like Fungus, Twine, Inform, and Ren'Py. However, LUTE differs by emphasising locative and XR experiences, rather than solely focusing on narrative-based ones. Additionally, it provides support for integrating custom components, enabling the creation of unique games with added depth and complexity.

Dr Jack Brett is the main author of LUTE along with Dr Yoan-Daniel Malinov .

Dr David Millard and Dr Charlie Hargood have also supported this project as principal investigators for the two work packages related to the LoGaCulture project from Bournemouth and Southampton University
